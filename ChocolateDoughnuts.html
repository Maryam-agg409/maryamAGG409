<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>50g caster sugar, plus 5- 6 heaped tbsp for coating the doughnuts</li>
<li>150ml whole milk</li>
<li>15g yeast</li>
<li>50g unsalted butter</li>
<li>320g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>2 egg yolks</li>
<li>Vegetable oil enough for deep-frying</li>
<li>250ml heavy cream</li>
<li>2-4 tbsp honey</li>
<li>250g chopped dark amd milk chocolate </li>
<li>60g unsalted cold butter, cubed</li>

<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon </li>
</ul>

<h2>Direction:</h2>
<ol>
<h3><ins> For the Dough </ins></h3>

<li>Heat the sugar and milk in a pan for about 5 minutes until the milk is warm and the sugar has dissolved.</li>
<li>Add yeast into a bowl and pour in half the warm milk. Mix and set side. </li>
<li>Place the remaining milk back on the heat and add the butter. Heat on low flame for about 3 minutes (the milk must not boil).</li>
<li>Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Add in the egg yolks, yeasted milk and the hot milk. Mix together to make a soft dough.</li>
<li>Knead the dough with your hands onto a floured surface for a few minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. (Dust with a little extra plain flour if the mix is too sticky).</li>
<li>Place the dough in a clean bowl and cover it with cling film. Set aside for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size. </li>

<h3><ins>For the Filling</ins></h3>

<li>Pour the cream in a saucepan and mix in the honey to your liking. </li>
<li>Put the chocolate and butter into a bowl. When the cream is almost boiling, pour it over the chocolate mixture and stir until well mixed, smooth and glossy.</li>

<h3><ins>Final Steps</ins></h3>

<li>Knead the risen dough again, lightly on a floured work surface. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 2cm and shape it into a rectangle. </li>
<li>Cut the dough into 12 smaller rectangles, and place them on a baking paper lined and leave to rise for 30-40 minutes until doubled in size, again. (This will make the doughnuts light and fluffy once cooked.)</li>
<li>Combine the remaining sugar with the nutmeg and cinnamon powder in a bowl (this will be used to coat the doughnuts). </li>
<li>Put the oil in a deep frying pan and heat the oil to 170Â°C.</li>
<li>Fry the doughnuts, in batches, for 3-4 minutes until evenly golden brown and cooked through. (You will need to moderate the heat between batches according to whether the doughnuts brown too quickly or too slowly.)</li>
<li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the doughnuts from the hot oil and roll in the nutmeg and cinnamon sugar to coat.</li>
<li>Fill a piping bag with the warm chocolate and use a small nozzle to fill the doughnuts.</li>
Serve after 10 mins or after the chocolate doesn't run and becomes thick.</li>
</ol>
